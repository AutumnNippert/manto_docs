It is a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and intergenerational initiative involving researchers and students in Australia and the USA.</p> <p>Our approach is guided by the intellectual premise that Greek myth existed in antiquity in what Tolkien described as a 'secondary world': it was a fictional universe with coherent spatial and chronological dimensions, and broadly consistent in its biological and cultural norms. Yet the Greek spatium mythicum departs from the purely fictional model of Middle Earth in two distinctive ways. Firstly, it was partially co-terminous with the ancient here-and-now of the 'primary world'. Mythic events took place in the deep past of the Mediterranean and so their traces lingered in the spatium historicum. Secondly, the Greek mythic storyworld was not the work of a single mind but created out of the improvisation and negotiation of thousands of disparate communities and hundreds of individual writers and artists over more than a millennium. These two qualities make Greek myth a complex target for analysis, but also a rich and rewarding one. Our ambitions to capture and organize the data of Greek myth must always be tempered by a very real appreciation for the inherent messiness of this material.</p> <p>You can read more about this project at https://www.manto-myth.org/manto(https://www.manto-myth.org/manto) and explore the data via the public interface at https://manto.unh.edu/viewer(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/scenario/1/geo/)</p> <p>This manual describes how we collect machine-readable mythic data from ancient texts.

This helps us to agree on basic principles so that we collect data in a relatively consistent way. Our ontology simplifies and homogenizes Greek myth to make it useful for many different ancient sources.</p> <p>We posit that a single timeline runs from the beginnings of the world to the present. This timeline contains both the spatium mythicum (the 'mythical period') and the spatium historicum (the 'historical period') (see fig. 1.1.1). These two periods are also distinct 'worlds' with their own norms of geography, chronology, biological and physical possibility, and social organization. So, for example, whereas people in the spatium mythicum may be born directly from the earth (i.e. by autochthony), this is not possible in the historical Mediterranean. Equally, whereas events in the spatium historicum can be recorded precisely as having happened in specific years, months, and even days; mythic time time can be marked only by generations, reigns, or by referencing significant events.</p> <p>!(media/image1.jpg)</p> <p>Figure 1.1.1: MANTO ontology for the Greek past (graphic: G. Goodwin)</p> <p>Even though the spatium mythicum and the spatium historicum are very different from one another, they are not unconnected. Because many of the events of Greek myth were said to have happened in the Mediterranean, the spatium mythicum still impacted the historical present. Cities were named for the heroes who founded them; there were tombs preserving heroic remains; very old objects were said to have been created by mythic craftsmen; rulers might claim gods and goddesses as ancestors. This means that various kinds of mythical relics were still encountered in the spatium mythicum.</p> <p>MANTO is a relational dataset (fig. 1.1.2). It breaks up myths into manageable 'factoids' and then uses these to construct a massive network. We are in effect capturing two kinds of relationships. The first kind is interactions between people, places and objects within the mythic storyworld. The second kind is the impacts that these people, places and objects had on the landscapes of the historical Mediterranean. Although these two kinds of relationships are theoretically distinct from one another, we capture them both at the same time using similar methods.</p> <p>At the core of MANTO is a list of 'entities'. These are specific people, places, objects (etc.) with ontological fixity: they are stable, unchanging, and identifiable. We then collect 'ties' that express connections between these entities. Each tie represents an assertion of fact found in an ancient source. Quite often the information in one tie will contradict information in another. Greek myth is full of variants and disputes so this is not surprising. We never try to decide whether any particular assertion is true or not. We simply capture them as evidence for how people have told stories about the Greek mythic world, and understood its impacts on the historical present.</p> <p>!(media/image2.jpg)</p> <p>Figure 1.1.2: Illustration of the concept of mythic networks (graphic: G.

Each tie represents an assertion made or implied in a specific piece of evidence from antiquity (e.g. a passage of text).</p> <p>All ties in MANTO have the form of a grammatically-standardized sentence, based on the semantic triple (subject - predicate - object), but with modifications and additions to allow us to capture more complex situations. The \\'nouns\\' in these sentences come from our dataset of entities; they are often written in CAPS in this manual for clarity. The predicates come from our list of interactions. Prepositional phrases, genitive absolutes, and purpose clauses are also allowed. (These are all listed in 2.7.2-4.) Figure 1.4.1 shows some examples of actual ties in our dataset from Apollodoros' Library:</p> <p>!alt text(media/image.png)</p> <p>Figure 1.4.1: Examples of Ties in MANTO. Entities are in caps (graphic: G. Goodwin)</p> <p>All ties must adhere to the same grammatically-standardized structure so that our data will be machine-readable; nonetheless, this is a highly flexible system that suits the richness of myth and allows for a great deal of autonomy in data collection.</p> <p>Always keep in mind how these ties will later be used. Firstly, MANTO works as an index of myth by connecting every entity back to a piece of ancient evidence. So, a user who searches for Apia would discover passage 2.1.1 in Apollodoros' Library; a user who searches for Deianeira would discover Apollod. Lib. 2.7.7.</p> <p>Secondly, these ties show the networks of the mythic storyworld. When entities appear together in a tie, we assume that there is some kind of relationship between them. This is why they are listed on each others' filecards as 'Related Entities'. From this we can create larger maps of relationships -- you can see these in the public interface by using the 'Network' tabs. These networks are essentially quantitative: they are shown as stronger or weaker based on the number of ties shared by two entities.</p> <p>A third use of this data takes advantage of the fact that our ties convey much more than the mere fact that a relationship exists between two entities. Each tie shows the kinds of relationships between entities: we can identify families, for example, or affinities between gods and particular places, or the way certain cities might have preserved objects connected to particular wars.</p> <p>Because our ties are quite specific, and our entities have certain attributes (like gender) assigned to them, from each piece of data we collect we can often deduce further information. So, from the third example in fig. 1.4.1 THERIMACHOS and CREONTIADES and DEICOON and IOLAOS is child of HERACLES and MEGARA we can create certain further statements, for instance:</p> <p>HERACLES is father of THERIMACHOS and CREONTIADES and DEICOON and IOLAOS</p> <p>MEGARA is mother of THERIMACHOS and CREONTIADES and DEICOON and IOLAOS</p> <p>THERIMACHOS is son of HERACLES and MEGARA</p> <p>MEGARA has children with HERACLES</p> <p>HERACLES has children with MEGARA</p> <p>THERIMACHOS and CREONTIADES and DEICOON and IOLAOS belong to the same generation</p> <p>HERACLES and MEGARA belong to a generation earlier than THERIMACHOS and CREONTIADES and DEICOON and IOLAOS</p> <p>Finally, it is important to understand what MANTO is not able to do. MANTO is like the supercharged index to a book: it helps the user navigate mythic sources, but is not intended to replace them. For example, MANTO does not capture how an author chooses to tell a myth. In the final example of fig.1.4.1, for example, it's not clear that Deianeira kills her husband Heracles without meaning to -- the tie 'kills' is used to capture all killings, but does not distinguish acts of cold-blooded murder from instances of battlefield slaughter, or unintentional homicide.</p>"},{"location":"1.%20Principles/principles/#15-reversals-and-filecards","title":"1.5 Reversals and Filecards","text":"<p>Having tens of thousands of complicated ties in a database is not much use unless we can sort through them quickly to find what we need.

Instead, you will add to them by triggering 'reversals'. Reversals are logical inferences that MANTO makes automatically based on the ties we supply and the attributes we assign to different entities.</p> <p>These reversals mean that we can work very efficiently and accurately. A single tie will often send different information to several filecards at the same time.

Equally, because we capture when a monster is described as a multi-species hybrid, or a place is said to be an entrance to the underworld, we can create lists of those particular phenomena too.

The ability to surface such examples with relative ease and then use them to analyze Greek myth at unprecedented scale is what makes MANTO a unique tool.

In theory, each has its own identity and is clearly distinct from all others.</p> <p>Your first task is to decide whether an entity should exist in MANTO. We want our dataset to be comprehensive, but that does not mean that we need to capture every last thing mentioned in every ancient source. Equally, we don't create a new entity if we can use an existing one. In general, we capture all entities that are either:</p> <p>(1) mythically significant (i.e. someone might search for them),</p> <p>(2) given a distinctive name,</p> <p>(3) act as nodes with ties to at least two other entities which would not otherwise be (as precisely) connected, or</p> <p>(4) required to capture a few historical phenomena</p> <p>Agents: All named characters must be created as entities. Characters without names can be ignored unless they create connections between entities that would not be otherwise apparent (i.e. criterion 3). This happens a lot in genealogies: i.e. to capture the fact that a hero is the grandson of another, you might have to create an anonymous mother or father. (For instructions on naming anonymous entities, see 2.4.1.3.)</p> <p>Objects: the third criterion ('act as nodes...') is also important in relation to objects. Where a weapon is mentioned solely as the means by which one hero kills another, it should not be captured as an entity since it adds nothing to our relational data except more detail. By contrast, an object like the Bow of Heracles (see fig. 1.1.2 (broken-link)) easily fulfills the third criterion since it has a biography of its own: Apollo gives it to Heracles, Heracles uses it to kill or wound various monsters, and Philoctetes inherits it. Objects later preserved as relics must be captured.</p> <p>Collectives: these should be created as seldom as possible. Collectives are only useful in MANTO when they represent distinct groups like siblings with a collective identity (e.g., 'the Daughters of Proitos'), heroes who come together to achieve a particular purpose (e.g., 'the Seven Against Thebes') or recognisable species (e.g., 'the Centaurs'). Large or indistinct groups like 'the Nymphs' should not be created, but significant groups of nymphs (e.g., the Dictaian Nymphs who raise Zeus) can be if necessary. Do not create a collective if a place could easily be used instead (e.g. use 'CADMOS rules THEBES' and not 'CADMOS rules THE THEBANS'.)</p> <p>Mythic Events: these should be created as seldom as possible. Mythic events are only useful in MANTO when they bring together agents and collectives who would not be connected in other ways. Do not create an event if a collective could be used instead (e.g use 'ACHILLES is member of THE GREEK CONTINGENT AT TROY' rather than creating 'the Trojan War'). We do create events for: (1) one-off games like the Funeral Games of Patroclos (see 2.8.11 for the reversals these trigger); (2) prominent weddings like that of Peleus and Thetis; (3) events that create damage etc and so are needed to create ties (e.g., the Flood of Deucalion); (4) events whose protagonist is immortal, and so capturing the event helps to establish chronological connections amongst other participants that wouldn't otherwise be apparent (e.g. the Search of Demeter for Persephone)</p>"},{"location":"2.%20Practices/2-3/#231-entity-types","title":"2.3.1 Entity types","text":"<p>Your second task is to decide which Entity Type you should create.

You must also make sure that you have captured some kind of relationship between entities that are connected somehow in the source. This means that you will want to make your ties as rich as possible and use prepositions, genitive absolutes, and purpose clauses to connect together as many entities as you can.</p> <p>You will often have several options about how you construct your ties.

As you become more familiar with the interactions described below (see 2.8.1-21(#interactions)) you will notice that several different ties can all be used to trigger the same reversal. This means that there are often several different ways to create the same end result. In general, creating fewer ties is better since this makes checking and revising data easier.</p> <p>Because you are always trying to trigger reversals with your ties, you should use ties that don't trigger more specific reversals (like 'is associated with' or 'is mentioned') only where there are no other options.</p>"},{"location":"2.%20Practices/2-5/#253-hierarchies","title":"2.5.3 Hierarchies","text":"<p>The only exception to the principle of trying to trigger as many reversals as possible is where actions exist in a kind of 'hierarchy'. These are clearly identified in the usage notes for interactions in 2.8.1-21(#interactions). So, for example, even though the interaction 'wounds' does trigger reversals (i.e. 'wounds', 'wounded by' etc) you should not use it if you can use 'blinds' or 'kills' instead, because those are more specific and significant actions. This principle is most apparent when you are capturing data from descriptions of fights between two heroes: Don't be tempted to try to retell the narrative using lots of ties; just follow the instructions in 2.8.1-21(#interactions) and capture the most significant actions.</p> <p>Because we focus on the most significant actions in myth, MANTO's dataset does not comprehensively capture all instances of an action even when we have a tie that seems to describe it. For example, searching for ties that use 'wounds' will not return all instances of wounding in Greek myth, because if the wounding involved blinding it would have been captured using 'blinds', and if the wounded person was later killed by the attacker, it would have been captured by 'kills'.</p>"},{"location":"2.%20Practices/2-5/#253-consistency","title":"2.5.3 Consistency","text":"<p>MANTO's 'grammar' is designed to be multi-purpose: it should work well with many different ancient sources.

In trying to retrieve just the 'facts' of myth, it tends to smooth out narratological differences. This information is not lost, since users of MANTO can always access the ancient versions themselves, but it is not going to appear in the data. In particular, our methodology is not well suited to expressing the internal lives of mythic characters, actions contemplated but not carried out, or ethical judgements added by the storyteller.</p> <p>Consistency is crucial across such a large project and makes checking and revising ties much easier. We will frequently encounter the same episodes in different passages and texts. If you are capturing a story that has already been captured, try to copy how it was captured previously if that makes sense in the passage you are working on---though doubtlessly you will find that some elements may be missing or altered, while others will need to be added.

All entities have names so that we can identify them easily, but entities are really concepts rather than labels; so, you should think of an entity like 'the Peloponnese' as expressing the concept of a particular location (i.e. the territory of the Peloponnese that constituted the kingdom of heroes like Phoroneus, Apis and Argos) even though this location was known by various different names.</p> <p>However, this simple principle does need to be broken sometimes.</p> <p>For the most part, where an entity has several different names we simply list them in the various fields under Name. This means that they can be used to search for that entity. So, if you search for either 'Alexandros' or 'Paris' you will find the entity 'Alexander(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8182124)' because both are listed as alternative names.</p> <p>We only create 'Alternative name' entities when we need an entity to capture information directly relevant to that name in the dataset. This usually means that they are needed to appear in ties like 'is eponym of', or 'changes name of'. So, in the example below, we already have a main entity 'the Peloponnese' but we also need to create alternative name entities for 'Apia(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8194366)' and 'Argos(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8360025)' to capture the assertion that Apis(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8182232) was the eponym of Apia and Argos(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8187815) was the eponym of Argos. (We connect the alternative name entities Apia and Argos to the main entity ('the Peloponnese') following the instructions in 2.4.1.1(#alternative-name-entities). This means that these alternative name entities should be easy to spot when you are entering data.)</p> <p>You will notice that these alternative name entities are just stubs: they mainly exist to direct the user to the main entity. They don't need attributes like Pleiades URNs or gender because they are identical to their main entities in these regards. And you will notice that they are only used in a few ties, since we use the main entities wherever possible. So, in the example below, we say that Phoroneus and Apis both ruled the Peloponnese even though the location was not known by that name at the time. E.g.,</p> <p>Apollodorus, Library 2.1.1-2: \"Phoroneus ruled over all the territory that would later be called the Peloponnesos. With the nymph Teledice he had Apis and Niobe. Apis turned his power into tyranny, was a violent dictator, and named the Peloponnesos Apia after himself ... Argos received the kingdom and called the Peloponnesos Argos after himself.\"</p> <p>PHORONEUS rules THE PELOPONNESE</p> <p>APIS, NIOBE is child of PHORONEUS, TELEDICE</p> <p>APIS succeeds PHORONEUS at THE PELOPONNESE</p> <p>APIS is eponym of APIA (ALT. PELOPONNESE)</p> <p>APIS names APIA (ALT. PELOPONNESE)</p> <p>ARGOS succeeds APIS at THE PELOPONNESE</p> <p>ARGOS is eponym of ARGOS (ALT. PELOPONNESE)</p> <p>ARGOS changes name of APIA (ALT. PELOPONNESE) to ARGOS (ALT. PELOPONNESE)</p> <p>The tie 'is alternative name for' exists to capture assertions about alternative names. You can use this with entities that are not treated in MANTO as alternative names if required. You do not need to use this tie every time a name that we treat as an 'alternative name entity' is used, but it is useful for (e.g.) capturing assertions about the local uses of names. E.g.:</p> <p>Pausanias 9.12.2: \"[Those who think that the Cadmus who came to the Theban land was an Egyptian, and not a Phoenician, have their opinion contradicted by the name of this Athena, because she is called by the Phoenician name of Onga, and not by the Egyptian name of Sais.\"]</p> <p>[ONGA (ALT. ATHENA) is alternative name for ATHENA; local tradition at: PHOINICIA, THEBES]</p> <p>[(Note that in the past we collected more data about alternative names than we do now, so you may notice that some of the older data doesn't conform with these instructions.)]</p> <p>'Alternative name entities' should not be created where an entity undergoes a profound transformation. In these instances they become a different entity. E.g., the heroine Ino(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8188585) transforms into the goddess Leucothea(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8189686) or the woman Cainis(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8189365) becomes the man Caineus(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8189365). There are examples amongst the places as well: e.g., the city of Troy(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8194710) was built on the Hill of Phrygian Ate. All of these entities are treated as main entities in MANTO because the transformation is not merely a change of name.</p>"},{"location":"4.%20Issues/4_issues/#47-panhellenic-games","title":"4.7 Panhellenic games","text":"<p>We capture one-off events like funeral games as mythic events, but not games that were celebrated regularly.

Fill out the columns with the name of the author, title of the text, passage numbers, and CTS URN link to Scaife (see 2.3) in the appropriate fields. Note that you can use Excel to generate sequential numbers. Finally, Excel removes trailing zeros from decimals (e.g. 2.100 is changed to 2.1). To adjust for this, select any passage numbers with two decimals (e.g. 2.10-2.99) -&gt; Right Click -&gt; Format Cells -&gt; Number -&gt; Category: Number, and set the Decimal Places from 2 to 1, then back to 2.

For example, the 'Athens(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8188815)' of myth can clearly be assumed to be located on the site of the historical city.</p> <p>But when the relationship between a mythical place and an historical place is not as straightforward, we need to capture this 'messiness' carefully.</p> <p>'Messy' relationships between places tend to be of two kinds. The first kind is where an (e.g.) epic poet describes a certain place, and there is later dispute over where that place was. A good example of this is Oichalia(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8254017). There is an archaic epic that tells of its sacking by Heracles in which it is treated as a specific place (probably on Euboia), but by the Hellenistic period several different cities claimed to have once been Oichalia. The second kind is where a place is obviously fictional in poetry but in later traditions it is located somewhere in the historical Mediterranean. So, for example, Circe's island of Aiaia(https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-9051582) is clearly a fantasy location in the Odyssey, but like many of the places Odysseus visits it was later said to be in southern Italy.</p> <p>When collecting data for MANTO, we treat both kinds of places in the same way. We create entities for the unlocatable places (e.g. 'Oichalia', 'Aiaia') and put the word 'unlocatable' in Information. We also create entities for each location in the spatium historicum that claimed to be this place and use the interaction 'is identified (as)' to connect them. E.g.:</p> <p>[Pausanias 4.2.3: \"The Thessalians say that Eurytium, which to-day is not inhabited, was formerly a city and was called Oechalia. The account given by the Euboeans agrees with the statements of Creophylus in his Heraeleia ; and Hecataeus of Miletus stated that Oechalia is in Scius, a part of the] territory of Eretria. Nevertheless, I think that the whole version of the Messenians is more probable than these, particularly on account of the bones of Eurytus, which my story will deal with later.\"</p> <p>OICHALIA (UNLOCATABLE) is identified as EURYTION</p> <p>Local tradition at: THESSALY</p> <p>Doubt or disbelief expressed: yes</p> <p>Alternatives given: yes</p> <p>EURYTOS is eponym of EURYTION</p> <p>Doubt or disbelief expressed: yes</p> <p>Data implicit: yes</p> <p>OICHALIA (UNLOCATABLE) is identified as OICHALIA (EUBOIA)</p> <p>Textual source: [Creophylos, Capture of Oichalia fr. 2; Hecataios fr. 28 ]</p> <p>Local tradition at: EUBOIA</p> <p>Doubt or disbelief expressed: yes</p> <p>Alternatives given: yes</p> <p>OICHALIA (UNLOCATABLE) is identified as CARNASION</p> <p>Local tradition at: MESSENIA</p> <p>Doubt or disbelief expressed: no</p> <p>Alternatives given: yes</p> <p>THE TOMB OF EURYTOS (CARNASION) is a relic at CARNASION</p> <p>You can see from the second and fifth ties that we collect any assertions relevant to the specific historical locations against those specific entities.</p> <p>It can be difficult in some instances to know whether to collect narrative data against the mythic location or one of the historical claimants.

Ideally you should also use the commentary field to alert the user (e.g. 'In this passage, Pausanias gives a rationalized account of Theseus and Peirithous' journey to the Underworld'). If the source expresses explicit skepticism of the mythic data, tag the tie with Doubt of disbelief expressed.</p> <p>If the characters in the rationalized version do things that do not happen in the traditional versions, and so the data looks very different from the data that we used to capture the traditional version, then you need to create new agents.
