# Style Guide

## 3.1 House Style

Proper names of entities, ancient authors etc should follow house style.
(Alternative name fields exist to capture other spellings,
transliterations):

Use Anglicized forms where these are more recognizable to aid search
functionality, e.g. Alexander, Helen, Athens.

The general preference is to use Greek forms of names where the entity
appears in both Greek and Roman traditions (e.g. "Aineias" rather than
"Aeneas"). Where the entity appears principally in Roman traditions,
use the Latin form, but be sure to add the Greek form in one of the
alternative names fields to aid searchability.

For Greek transliteration, use the following:

> κ (kappa) -- c (we make exceptions for names like 'Nike' (and
> compounds), 'Dike' (and compounds), 'Kore', and
>
> χ (chi) -- ch
>
> ο (omicron) -- o
>
> η (eta) -- e (except following an iota at the end of a word, e.g.
> Γυγαίη \> Gygai**a**, not Gygai**e**)
>
> γγ (etc.) -- ng
>
> ρ -- rh at the beginning of a syllable, r elsewhere
>
> **-ros** / -er (e.g. Meleag**ros** not Meleag**er**)
>
> **-ai-** / -ae- (e.g. **Ai**gyptos not **Ae**gyptos)
>
> **-ei-** / -e- or -i- (e.g. Heracl**ei**dai not Heracl**e**dai or
> Heraclidai)
>
> **-ou-** / -u- (e.g. Diosc**ou**roi not Diosc**u**roi)
>
> **-oo-** / -ou- (e.g. Hippoc**oo**n not Hippoc**ou**n)
>
> **-medes** / -mede (e.g. Gany**medes** not Gany**mede**)
>
> \-**oi-** /-oe- (e.g. **Oi**neus not **Oe**neus)

When rough breathing appears before a vowel, spell with an initial
'h'. E.g. Ἅλος \> Halos.

We do not use macrons to distinguish between long vowels and short
vowels.

Where the name does not appear in Greek texts, use the most familiar
Latin form as house style.

When creating a name for an entity, The following conventions should be
used:

Use 'of' wherever possible and avoid apostrophes -- i.e. 'the Club of
Heracles' not 'Heracles' Club'. Adjectives should only be used where
necessary owing to familiarity (e.g. the Trojan Horse, the Calydonian
Boar).

Use maximal capitalization. Where 'the', 'of', 'at' etc. are included
in the name of an entity, they should be lowercase. All other words
should be capitalized - e.g. the Thunderbolt of Zeus, the
Hundred-Handers, the Walls of Troy, the Skin of the Calydonian Boar.

NB: the Greek and Trojan contingents at Troy differ from these
conventions (e.g. 'the Thracian contingent at Troy' rather than 'the
Contingent of the Thracians at Troy'). We have based their names on
the subheadings given in Kirk's commentary.

For entities in the mythic world, use Anglicized equivalents of object
descriptions. (You can add the Greek term(s) in **[Name
(transliteration)]** to aid searchability). Be as
consistent as possible and follow existing practice; E.g.:

For the names of artifacts you can use transliterated names of vessels
(etc), using "k" rather than "c" to follow the wider convention in the
field. E.g. "Kylix", "Krater".

When entering text in free-text fields that will be visible in the
public interface (e.g., **Commentary, Information**) give
names in house style and use American English.
