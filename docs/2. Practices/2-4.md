# 2.4 Creating entities
> TODO: 2.4.1 is at the bottom of 2.4 instead of the top

Entities are given attributes (called 'sub-objects' in Nodegoat).
Nodegoat does not restrict which attributes you can use with which
* **Entity Type**, but in practice you will give different
kinds of attributes to different types of entities. Sometimes attributes
are used differently between entity types.

Read the instructions in the next sections carefully. Adding specific
words to certain fields will trigger reversals. If these reversals are
not accurate in the case of the entity you are creating, keep the
relevant field(s) empty and leave a note explaining why you did this.

Use **Note, Commentary,** and **[Attention
Required]** as necessary (see
[2.1 getting-help](#21-getting-help)). The checkboxes that appear after
**Modified?** relate to specific research projects: do not
touch these.

If you are creating entities that represent alternative names or
rationalized forms of other entities, or personifications, or the entity
you are creating doesn't have a name, read
[2.4.1.1-4 alternative-name-entities](#2411-alternative-name-entities) first.

## 2.4.1 Creating special kinds of entities 

There are some special kinds of entities that are found in all entity
types. These instructions should be followed even where they contradict
what you read in
[2.4.2-8 creating-agents-and-collectives](#242-creating-agents-and-collectives).

### 2.4.1.1 Alternative name entities

Only create alternative names entities if the name is needed to create
ties about naming, eponyms, and etymologies. (In all other instances,
just add the name(s) as free text in the **[Alternative names]** field of the main entity.)

> Use the same **Entity Type** and **Entity
> Subtype** as the main entity.
> 
> Use '(alt. [main entity name])' in **Minimal
> Disambiguation.**
> 
> Use 'alternative name for [main entity name]' at the beginning of
> **Information.**
> 
> Enter the main entity in **Alternative Name For**.
> 
> **Populates filecard category 'alternative name'**
> 
> **'Alternative name' entities nest within main entity (see
> [4.14 nesting-entities](#414-nesting-entities)); any 'related entities' of
> the alternative name entity will also populate the main entity.**

These alternative name entities are just stubs that direct the user to
the main entity; do not enter anything in the rest of the fields. For
further details on the use of alternative name entities, see
[4.6 alternative-names](#46-alternative-names).

### 2.4.1.2 Rationalized form entities

Only create entities to capture rationalized forms where existing
entities cannot be used.
> 
> Use the same **Entity Type** and **[Entity
> Subtype]** as the main entity.
> 
> Use '(rat. [main entity name])' in **Minimal
> Disambiguation.** If it is not a rationalization of a
> specific entity in MANTO (e.g. [Tricarenia](https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-11296441)),
> use '(rationalized)'.
> 
> Use 'rationalized form of \main entity name\' at the beginning of
> **Information.** If it is not a rationalization of a
> specific entity in MANTO (e.g. [Tricarenia](https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-11296441)),
> use 'rationalized' somewhere in **Information**.
> 
> Enter the main entity in **Rationalized form of** where
> appropriate.
> 
> **Populates filecard category 'rationalized form'**

Complete other fields as required for the entity type. For further
details on the use of rationalized form entities, see [4.13](#413).

### 2.4.1.3 Anonymous entities

If an entity is not named in the source you are working on but is named
elsewhere, then use that name and record your decision in
**Note** or **Commentary.** If an entity is
never given a name in our ancient sources, you must:

> Create a **Name** that describes the entity: e.g.
> '[Mother of Areion](https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-11289354)'
> (note: maximum capitalization, no 'the').
> 
> Use '(name unknown)' in **Minimal Disambiguation.**

Complete other fields as required for the entity type.

### 2.4.1.4 Personifications

See [4.8 personifications](#48-personifications-1) for information on
personifications.

> For personifications of abstract concepts, use the Greek form (e.g.
> 'Eros') in **Name** and add English translation(s) (e.g.
> 'Love', 'Desire') as free text in **Alternative Names**.
> 
> For personifications of abstract concepts, include 'personification of
> [English translation]' in **Information**; for
> personifications of rivers, include 'river god' in
> **Information**.
> 
> Where this entity is the personification of another entity in MANTO
> (e.g. the river god Acheloos is the personification of River
> Acheloos), enter the main entity in **Personification
> Of**.
> 
> **Populates filecard category 'Personification'**

Complete other fields as required for the entity type.

## 2.4.2 Creating agents and collectives 

#### Name
> **Name:** This is a required field. Follow house style
> (see [3.1 house-style](#31-house-style)) and existing practice.
> 
> **Agents and collectives with 'Cattle', 'Cow', 'Bull', 'Mare' 'Horse',
> 'Dog', 'Sheep', 'Lamb', 'Ram', 'Dove', 'Serpent', 'Turtle' 'Livestock'
> in Name populate the filecard categories 'animal/animals
> belonging to', 'animals' when Of contains an agent or
> collective. (If the animal has a proper name, use that here. Placing
> '(horse)' or '(dog)' in Minimal Disambiguation will also
> trigger this reversal.)**

The next name fields are optional. They are free text fields that aid
findability; i.e. if a user searches for 'Paris' or 'Alexandros'
Nodegoat will return the entity 'Alexander' because they are listed as
alternative names.

##### Name (Transliteration)
> **Name (transliteration):** The name of the entity as
> strictly transliterated from the Greek if different from the house
> style (κ = k, χ = ch, ῥ = rh, αι = ai, γγ (etc.) = ng). Multiple names
> are allowed in this field; enter each in a separate box by clicking
> 'Add'.

##### Name (Greek Font)
> **Name (Greek Font):** The name of the entity as it
> appears in Greek with polytonic accents. Multiple names are allowed in
> this field; enter each in a separate box by clicking 'Add'.

##### Name (Latinized)
> **Name (Latinized):** The name of the entity as rendered
> in a Latinized transliteration from the Greek if different from the
> house style. These forms are typically used in Loeb editions. Multiple
> names are allowed in this field; enter each in a separate box by
> clicking 'Add'.

##### Name In Latin Texts
> **Name in Latin texts:** The name as used by Latin
> authors if different from the house style (e.g. Jupiter, Hercules,
> Pollux). Multiple names are allowed in this field; enter each in a
> separate box by clicking 'Add'.

##### Alternative Names
> **Alternative names:** Any alternative spellings or
> forms, or other names this entity is known by. Multiple names are
> allowed in this field; enter each in a separate box by clicking 'Add'.

#### Minimal Disambiguation
> **Minimal disambiguation:** These appear alongside the
> name in the public interface and help users distinguish between entities
> with the same or similar names. The information that you give here must
> go in round brackets '()'. It should be as brief as possible. Use '&'
> not 'and', '/' not 'or'. Use minimal capitalization.
> 
> For agents and collectives, add a minimal disambiguation only if the
> name is identical to or likely to be confused with the name of another
> agent or collective. Use either an adjective of a place they are
> particularly associated with ('(Athenian)', '(Arcadian)', an
> abbreviated genealogy ('(f. of Alexandros)'), or description of
> prominent role ('(thunderbolt-makers)'). Distinguish further with
> Roman numerals if necessary (e.g. '(Trojan I)', '(Trojan II)').
>
> TODO: No Closing Paren for ('(Athenian)...
> 
> Fictional agents or collectives created by other agents should include
> the word 'persona' (e.g. '(Odyssean persona)').
> 
> **Agents with '(horse)' or '(dog)' in [Minimal disambiguation] populate the filecard categories 'animal/animals belonging to', 'animals' when Of contains an agent or collective. This reversal can also be triggered using Name.**

#### Information
> **Information:** This is an optional, free text field. In
> the data collection interface it appears as part of the name. In the
> public interface it appears on the filecard. Give the most pertinent
> information about this entity to help others identify it accurately.
> More information can be given in **Note** or
> **Commentary.**

#### Alternative Name For
> **Alternative name for:** See
> [2.4.1.1 alternative-name-entities](#2411-alternative-name-entities).

#### Possibly The Same As
> **Possibly the same as:** Use where we do not have enough
> information to determine whether two or more entities are different, and
> it is possible that they are in fact the same. Only use this attribute
> with one entity (a reversal will populate the others).
> 
> **Populates filecard category 'possibly the same as'**
>
> TODO: other(s) is not present in this one compared to the others

#### Rationalized Form Of
> **Rationalized form of:** See
> [2.4.1.2 rationalized-form-entities](#2412-rationalized-form-entities).

#### Personification Of
> **Personification of:** See
> [2.4.1.4 personifications](#2414-personifications).

#### Of
> **Of:** Used to create high-level connections between
> entities which are inherent to them. If the 'of' in a collective's name
> refers to their parent(s) (e.g. 'the Children of Niobe'), use
> **Children Of** instead.
> 
> **Populates filecard category 'Related entities'**

**Wikidata:**{.red}
Enter Wikidata identifier, which is a string
of numbers beginning with "Q". Do not enter the full URL as Nodegoat
will create that from the identifier. Multiple names are allowed in this
field.

#### LIMC Headword
> **LIMC headword:** We are not currently collecting LIMC
> data, so you do not need to enter anything in this field. (Where
> entered, use the exact form as given in headings in LIMC (e.g. 'Briareos
> II'); multiple names are allowed in this field.)

#### Gender
> **Gender:** All agents and collectives must have a gender
> attribute. Use 'undefined' where (a) the gender of an agent is not
> knowable; (b) the gender of an agent is fluid; (c) a collective is (or
> might be) made up of both males and females.

#### Children Of
> **Children Of:** If the collective has a parent that is
> stable in the tradition, give it here: e.g. the Danaids are children of
> Danaos, the Sons of Lycaon are children of Lycaon. More than one parent
> can be entered.
> 
> **Populates filecard categories 'children of', 'mother/father of'. If
> the collective has Entity Subtype 'collective without
> members' it populates filecard category 'parent of'. If [Children Of] contains a collective, it populates filecard category
> 'parents of'.**

#### Part Of
> **Part Of** Where a collective is a sub-group of a larger
> collective, enter the name of the larger collective here. So, for
> example, '[the Mycenae Contingent](https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8190247)'
> that fights at Troy is 'part of' the larger '[Greek Contingent](https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/object/6580-8190050)'.
> This 'nests' (see [4.14 nesting-entities](#414-nesting-entities)) collectives
> inside each other.
> 
> **Populates filecard category 'subgroups'**

## 2.4.3 Creating objects 

#### Name
> **Name:** This is a required field. Follow house style
> (see [3.1 house-style](#31-house-style)) and existing practice. Use
> maximal capitalization, and 'the' where needed; e.g. 'the Bow of
> Artemis'.
> 
> **Objects with 'Bones' in Name populate filecard
> categories 'remains of', 'body parts' when Of is used.**
> 
> **Objects with 'Finger', 'Skin', 'Genital', 'Thigh', 'Shoulder',
> 'Teeth', 'Tooth' 'Blood', 'Hair', 'Head', 'Tusk', 'Horn', 'Bone of',
> 'Umbilical cord' in Name populate filecard categories
> 'body part of', 'body parts' when Of is used.**
> 
> **Objects with 'Shield', 'Scabbard', 'Sword', 'Armour', 'Bow',
> 'Arrow', 'Club', 'Breastplate', 'War-belt', 'Helmet', 'Quiver',
> 'Thunderbolt', 'Spear', 'Dagger', 'Axe', 'Trident' in
> Name populate filecard categories 'weapon of',
> 'weaponry' when Of is used.**

The next name fields are optional. They are free text fields that aid
findability; i.e. if a user searches for 'Paris' or 'Alexandros'
Nodegoat will return the entity 'Alexander' because they are listed as
alternative names.

##### Name (Transliteration)

The next name fields are optional. They are free text fields that aid
findability; i.e. if a user searches for 'Paris' or 'Alexandros'
Nodegoat will return the entity 'Alexander' because they are listed as
alternative names.

##### Name (Transliteration)
> **Name (transliteration):** The name of the entity as
