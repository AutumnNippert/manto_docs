# 2.8 Interactions

Restrictions on the use of each interaction appear in notes next to
them. Unless otherwise specified, any entity can be used with any
interaction. The prepositions typically used with each one are given in
square brackets, but these are not an exhaustive list.

Many interactions trigger reversals when used in particular ways. If the
reversal is not accurate in this context, then do not use that
interaction in that way. (For an explanation of reversals, see
1.5(#reversals-and-filecards).)

## 2.8.1 Qualities 

* **ENTITY has hybrid form**

Use where an entity is explicitly said to be a mixture or blending of
two or more species, e.g. the Centaurs, the Minotaur, Pegasos. Use
where an entity is both hybrid and monstrous. Use also to capture
passages where the hybridity of traditionally hybrid creatures is
explicitly denied and tag with 'Doubt or disbelief expressed'.

* **Triggers phenomenon 'monstrosity and hybridity'**

* **ENTITY has monstrous form**

Use where an entity is explicitly said to have some unconventional
physical characteristic, excluding hybridity, e.g. unusual size,
single eye (Polyphemos), extra limbs (Hundred-handers). If the
monstrosity is accompanied by some aspect of hybridity, use 'has
hybrid form' instead. Use also to capture passages where the
monstrosity of traditionally monstrous creatures is explicitly denied
and tag with 'Doubt or disbelief expressed'.

* **Triggers phenomenon 'monstrosity and hybridity'**

## 2.8.2 Blood relationships

Ties using these interactions typically only involve agents and
collectives.

Blood relationships are exceptions to the usual rule that we try to make
each tie as rich as possible. Do not add prepositions, genitive
absolutes or purpose clauses to these interactions. If an episode of
childbirth is described, use 'is born', or 'gives birth' as well.

* **ENTITY1 is child of ENTITY2**

If ENTITY1 is a collective that already has Children of:
ENTITY2 as an attribute, do not enter that information again in this
tie.

**Populates filecard categories 'son/daughter/child of', 'children
of', 'mother/father of', 'parents of', 'has children with'**

* **ENTITY is sibling of ENTITY**

Use only where you cannot use 'is child of', with the name(s) of the
parent(s) implied.

* **ENTITY is twin of ENTITY**

* **Populates filecard categories 'twin of'**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'mythic twins'**

* **ENTITY1 is mother by parthenogenesis of ENTITY2**

Use where a mother conceives her offspring on her own. Do not use if
the father is simply unknown.\
**Populates filecard categories 'son/daughter/child of', 'mother of',
'gives birth by parthenogenesis to'**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'parthenogenesis', 'unusual births'**

* **ENTITY has no children**

Use only where an agent is explicitly said to have died childless

* **ENTITY is a descendant of ENTITY**

Use only where the exact relationship between two agents is not
apparent and cannot be extrapolated from data elsewhere (even by the
creation of anonymous figures). These relationships are difficult to
code accurately so might not be able to be included in visualizations.
For descendants in historical period, use \'is claimed as ancestor\'.

* **Populates filecard category 'descendant of'**

* **ENTITY1 is claimed as ancestor** \in/on/at ENTITY2\

Use only where the person or group making the claim exists in the
historical period. Do not use where an historical figure (e.g.
Alexander the Great) claims to have a god for a parent. Use with a
timemark; if the timemark is left empty, the claim to ancestry was
being made at the time when the passage was written.

## 2.8.3 Relationships by marriage

* **ENTITY1 is spouse of ENTITY2**

If a more detailed episode is described, use 'marries' or 'gives in
marriage'.

* **Populates filecard category 'wife/husband of'**

* **ENTITY1 marries ENTITY2**

* **Populates filecard category 'wife/husband of'**

* **ENTITY1 gives in marriage ENTITY2** \indir. obj. ENTITY3\

* **Populates filecard category 'wife/husband of'**

* **ENTITY1 offers in marriage ENTITY2** \indir. obj. ENTITY3\

Use where a marriage did not take place, or to capture (e.g.) the
place the marriage arrangement was made. If the marriage takes place
later, use 'marries' or 'is spouse of' as well.


## 2.8.4 Birth

Use only if childbirth episode is described, or other entities need to
be captured in relation to it. Otherwise use one of the 'blood
relationships' interactions in 2.14.2.

* **ENTITY1 is born** \in/on/at ENTITY2\] \[from ENTITY3\ \[with
involvement of ENTITY4\]

Use where location of birth is significant, or episode of birth is
significant and mother is not identified (if she needs to be captured,
use 'gives birth'). ENTITY3 will be something which does not typically
give birth (e.g. 'the Head of Medousa', 'the Eggs of Leda'). ENTITY4
is an agent that causes ENTITY1 to be born by (e.g.) scattering
dragon's teeth.

**Populates filecard categories 'born at', 'born from', 'place of
birth of', 'from which is created'.**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'unusual births' if 'from' is used**

* **ENTITY1 gives birth** \indir.obj. ENTITY2\] \[in/on/at ENTITY3\

This tie does not trigger genealogical reversals; use 'is child of'
(etc) as well.

* **Populates filecard categories 'born at', 'place of birth of'**

* **ENTITY1 is born by autochthony** \in/on/at ENTITY2\

Autochthons are agents and collectives who are born out of the earth
without the involvement of parents. Capture only explicit instances of
autochthony. Do not capture these as children of Ge / Gaia. ENTITY2
should typically be a region or city. If the birth is from an object
(etc) use 'is born [from'.

* **Populates filecard category 'born at', 'place of birth of'**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'autochthons', 'unusual births'**

* **ENTITY1 comes into being**

Use where an entity spontaneously comes into existence, e.g. Gaia,
Chaos etc in Hesiod's *Theogony*. Use 'is born by autochthony' if the
entity is born from the earth in a place.\
**Triggers phenomenon 'comes into being at the beginning of the
world', 'unusual births'**

## 2.8.5 Death

* **ENTITY1 kills ENTITY2** \using ENTITY3\

**Populates filecard category 'dies at', 'place of death of', 'killed
by', 'kills',**

**If 'using' contains an object or landmark, populates 'killed by' and
'used to kill'**

* **ENTITY dies**

Use only when more specific ties (e.g. 'kills\' or \'dies by suicide\')
are not appropriate.

* **Populates filecard category 'dies at', 'place of death of'**

* **ENTITY dies by suicide**

* **Populates filecard category 'dies at', 'place of death of'**

* **If 'using' contains an object or landmark, populates 'used to kill'**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'deaths by suicide'**

* **ENTITY disappears**

Use when an agent disappears rather than dies.

* **Populates filecard category ' disappears at'**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'disappearing heroes'**

* **ENTITY mourns ENTITY**

* **ENTITY resurrects ENTITY**

Use where one agent returns another to life. Where the resurrection
involves an agent bringing another formerly-living agent back from the
Underworld, use 'ENTITY takes ENTITY from THE UNDERWORLD').

* **Populates filecard category 'resurrected at', 'resurrected by'**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'resurrected heroes'**

* **ENTITY has post-mortem existence** \in/on/at\

Use where an agent is described as existing after death in some form
(e.g. on the Isles of the Blessed) or appears as a ghost in the
terrestrial realm.

* **Populates filecard category 'has post-mortem existence at'**

* **Triggers phenomenon**

* **ENTITY1 buries ENTITY2** \in/on/at ENTITY3\

Use only where an agent disposes of a body after death. Use even when
the body is not literally buried but (e.g.) placed on a funeral pyre.
Use 'hides' where an object is buried in earth for safekeeping, etc.
ENTITY3 should be a place or landmark (e.g. 'the Tomb of Achilles').
Where the tomb is a relic in historical period, use also 'is a relic'.

**Populates filecard categories 'buried at', 'buried by', 'burial
place of'**

* **ENTITY recovers the body of ENTITY** [from] [to]

* **ENTITY has cenotaph** \in/on/at\

Use in the form \'AGENT has cenotaph at PLACE\' (* **not**
\'PLACE has cenotaph of AGENT\'). Use where tomb is specifically said
not to include a body; where a body is present, use 'buries' above.
Where the cenotaph is a relic in historical period, use also 'is a
relic'.

* **Populates filecard categories 'cult sites', 'cult site of'**

## 2.8.6 Roles and non-familial relationships 

Most of the interactions in this category have similar interactions in
other categories (e.g. 'is prophet' / 'gives prophecy' etc.) We use the
interactions listed in this category where the role is considered
integral to an entity's identity, or the entity is described primarily
in terms of the role but not described as necessarily performing the
action. Typically these ties populate filecard categories, whereas the
other ties do not.

* **ENTITY1 is slave** \of ENTITY2\

Use where the agent's primary identity is as slave of another; \'sells
as slave\' also exists to capture the specific action, especially
where the state of slavery is not permanent. 'Wins as warprize' also
exists. See 2.8.12(#capturing-enslaving-imprisoning).\
* **Populates filecard category 'enslaved to'**

Use \'teaches\' to capture the specific action\
* **Populates filecard category 'teacher of'**

* **ENTITY1 is priest** \of ENTITY2\] \[in/on/at ENTITY3\

ENTITY2 should be the divinity ENTITY2 is priest of; ENTITY3 should be
temple or sanctuary. For more specific ritual interactions, see
2.8.15(#ritual-interactions).

**Populates filecard categories 'priest/priestess of', 'priest/priestess
at'**

* **ENTITY is divine patron** \of\

Use where a god or goddess has a particularly close relationship with
a hero or place.\
* **Populates filecard category 'divine patron of'**

* **ENTITY1 is prophet** \of ENTITY2\] \[in/on/at\

ENTITY2 should be the agent or collective to whom ENTITY2 gives
prophecies, and/or the deity that the prophecies come from. Where an
agent is prophet of Apollo at Delphi, put 'Apollo' in 'of' field, and
'the Oracle of Apollo (Delphi)' in 'in/on/at' field. \'Gives
prophecy\' and 'grants power of prophecy' also exist (see
2.8.15(#ritual-interactions)).

* **Populates filecard categories 'prophet of', 'prophet at'**

**If ENTITY2 is a collective, populates filecard categories 'includes',
'belongs to'**

## 2.8.7 Names and Transformation 

* **ENTITY is eponym of ENTITY**

An eponym is the hero(ine) after whom a place is named. Where eponym
is also founder or ruler, use 'founds as eponym' or 'rules as eponym'.

* **Populates filecard categories 'eponym of', 'eponym'**

* **ENTITY1 derives etymology** \from ENTITY2\

Use where etymology is not a simple case of eponymy. ENTITY2 should
have significance for the etymology even if that significance is not
immediately clear from the names. Explain the connection in
* **Commentary** where necessary.

* **Populates filecard category 'derives etymology from'**

* **ENTITY1 names ENTITY2** \to honor ENTITY3\

Use where ENTITY2 has no previous name, e.g. the first naming of
cities. ENTITY3 is what ENTITY2 is named after. If ENTITY2 has an
eponym or etymology, capture that in a separate tie as well.

* **Populates filecard category 'named by'**

* **ENTITY1 changes name to ENTITY2** \to honor ENTITY3\

Use where ENTITY1's name changes, but there you cannot capture an
entity that does the renaming. (Where ENTITY1 is given a new name by
someone else, use 'changes name of'.) ENTITY3 is what ENTITY2 is named
after. Where the name change happens during deification, use \'becomes
immortal\' instead. If ENTITY2 has an eponym or etymology capture that
in a separate tie as well. This interaction does not
populate the filecard categories 'alternative name' and 'alternative
name for'.

* **ENTITY1 changes name of ENTITY2** \ind.obj. ENTITY3\ \[to honor
ENTITY4\]

Use where ENTITY1 changes the name of ENTITY2, which already has a
name. ENTITY4 is what ENTITY3 is named after. Where the name change
happens during deification, use \'becomes immortal\' instead. If
ENTITY3 has an eponym or etymology capture in a separate tie as well.
This interaction does not populate the filecard
categories 'alternative name' and 'alternative name for'.

* **Populates filecard category 'named by'**

* **ENTITY1 is alternative name for ENTITY2**

Use where it is specifically asserted that two names refer to the same
entity, or where the usage in the passage suggests this connection. If
one of the entities is an 'alternative name' entity (see
2.4.1.1(#alternative-name-entities)), make that one
ENTITY1. Where the alternative name is used specifically in a
particular place, use the 'local tradition at' field. This interaction
does not populate the filecard categories 'alternative
name' and 'alternative name for'.

* **ENTITY1 metamorphoses ENTITY2** \into ENTITY3\

ENTITY2 undergoes metamorphosis; ENTITY1 (usually a god) directly
instigates the process. Capture ENTITY3 only where it exists as an
entity in MANTO. This tie will always have a direct object: where an
agent metamorphoses themselves or the instigator of the metamorphosis
is not identified, use 'is metamorphosed'. Any actions done by ENTITY2
in metamorphosed form should be captured against the original identity
if the metamorphosis is later reversed.

* **Populates filecard categories 'transformed into', 'transformed from'**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'metamorphosis'**

* **ENTITY1 is metamorphosed** \into ENTITY2\

ENTITY1 undergoes metamorphosis. Capture ENTITY2 only where it exists
as an entity in MANTO. This tie should be used where an agent
metamorphoses themselves or the instigator of the metamorphosis is not
identified. Where a direct instigator is identified, use 'is
metamorphosed'. Any actions done by ENTITY1 in metamorphosed form
should be captured against the original identity if the metamorphosis
is later reversed.

* **Triggers phenomenon 'mortals who become gods'**

* **ENTITY1 takes form of ENTITY2**

Use where ENTITY1 (typically a god) temporarily takes on the form of
another entity. Actions performed by that entity when in disguise
should be captured against ENTITY1.

* **ENTITY1 invents ENTITY2**

Use where ENTITY1 creates ENTITY2 as a fictional persona either to
serve as an alias, or to be used in made-up stories. Where ENTITY1
creates a physical person (e.g. Pandora), use 'creates'.

* **ENTITY1 grants superhuman power** \ind.obj. ENTITY2\

ENTITY1 is a divine figure who grants a superhuman power to ENTITY2.
ENTITY2 must be a hero or heroine and not (e.g.) a monster, animal, or
object. Where ENTITY2 has superhuman power but no god is identified as
granting it, use '\BLANK\] grants power \[ind.obj. ENTITY2\. Where
the power is specifically said to be prophecy, use 'grants power of
prophecy'.

* **Populates filecard category 'granted superhuman power by'**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'superhuman powers'**

* **ENTITY1 grants power of prophecy** \ind.obj. ENTITY2\

ENTITY1 is a divine figure who grants the power of prophecy to
ENTITY2. Where ENTITY2 is described as being granted prophetic power
but no god is identified as granting it, use '\BLANK\ grants power
of prophecy \ind.obj. ENTITY2\'. 'Is prophet' and 'gives prophecy'
also exist.

* **Populates filecard category 'granted power of prophecy by'**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'superhuman powers'**

* **ENTITY1 gives prophecy** \ind.obj. ENTITY2\

ENTITY1 is the source of the prophecy, either the god or the prophet
or both. If the prophecy is given at Delphi and comes from Apollo,
ENTITY1 should be 'Oracle of Apollo' (see
4.3(#prophecies-at-delphi)).

* **ENTITY1 appears in an epiphany** \ind.obj. ENTITY2\ \[in/on/at
ENTITY3\]

Where the epiphany occurs in the historical period, use 'appears as an
epiphany in the historical period'.

* **ENTITY1 appears in an epiphany in the historical period** \[in/on/at
ENTITY2\]

ENTITY3 is the location where the epiphany occurred. Use with a
timemark; if the timemark is left empty, the epiphany occurred when
the passage was written. Where the epiphany occurs in the mythical
period, use 'appears in an epiphany'.

## 2.8.16 Possession, creation, usage, and gifting

* **ENTITY possesses ENTITY**

Use only if not captured by a more specific interaction.

* **ENTITY creates humans**

Use only where an entity creates humankind. Where an entity creates a
specific human (e.g. Pandora), use 'creates'.

* **Populates filecard category 'humans created onsite by'**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'creators of humans'**

* **ENTITY1 creates ENTITY2** \from ENTITY3\

ENTITY3 is something which ENTITY1 uses to create ENTITY2. Where
ENTITY2 is a sanctuary, use 'establishes cult'; where ENTITY2 is a
fictional agent, use 'invents'.

**Populates filecard categories 'created at', 'created by', 'creates',
'created from', 'from which is created'**

**If ENTITY2 contains 'walls', 'gate', populates filecard category
'fortified by'.**

**Triggers phenomenon 'creators of humans' if ENTITY2 is a collective or
agent**

* **ENTITY destroys ENTITY**

Where ENTITY2 is also conquered, use 'conquers' as well.

* **Populates filecard category 'destroyed by'**

* **ENTITY1 damages ENTITY2**

Use only if 'destroys' is not appropriate.

* **ENTITY discards ENTITY2**

ENTITY2 is typically an object. 'Abandons' exists for agents.

* **ENTITY consumes ENTITY**

Use in contexts of eating and drinking.

* **ENTITY takes ENTITY** [from] [to] [via]

* **ENTITY1 gives** **ENTITY2** \ind.obj. ENTITY3\] \[for ENTITY4\

If the thing given is not an entity in MANTO, use 'gives something'.
Where ENTITY2 is a kingdom, use also 'rules', 'succeeds' etc to
trigger reversals. ENTITY4 is something given in exchange. 'Gives in
marriage', 'grants power (of prophecy)', 'gives special gift',
'dedicates' also exist.

* **ENTITY1 gives something \ind. obj. ENTITY2\**

Use only where the thing given is not an object in MANTO; otherwise,
use 'gives'.

* **ENTITY offers ENTITY** \ind.obj.\

Use only if the offer is not accepted, or promised but never
delivered. 'Offers in marriage' also exists.

* **ENTITY hides ENTITY** [from

Use either to capture an entity hiding another, or an entity hiding
him or herself (i.e. ENTITY hides \[BLANK). For disappearances
analogous to death, use 'disappears'; for the hiding of bodies in the
ground, use 'buries'.

## 2.8.17 Collectives and Groups

Agents can also be enrolled as members of collectives using 'is herald,
'is helmsman', 'is healer', 'is prophet' (see
2.8.6(#roles-and-non-familial-relationships)).

Sub-groups can be nested inside larger collectives using the entity
attribute **Part of**. Where an agent is a member of a
subgroup, they will also appear in the filecard categories 'belongs to'
and 'includes' in relation to the larger collective.

**ENTITY1 leads ENTITY2\
ENTITY2 must be a collective.**

**Populates filecard categories 'led by', 'includes', 'leader of',
'belongs to'**

* **ENTITY assembles ENTITY**

* **ENTITY1 is member of ENTITY2**

ENTITY1 is typically an agent; ENTITY2 is always a collective. Use to
express membership of agents in collectives. If the collective is a
group of siblings (e.g. "the Children of Niobe"), you will need to
also create a "is child of" tie.\
* **Populates filecard categories 'includes', 'belongs to'**

## 2.8.18 Rulership and Landownership

* **ENTITY1 rules ENTITY2** \for ENTITY3\] \[from ENTITY4\

ENTITY2 should be a place. Where a king or kingdom is strongly
associated with both a region and a capital city within that region,
give both as ENTITY2 (E.g. 'Pandion rules Athens, Attica'). ENTITY3 is
a minor or absent ruler for whom ENTITY1 acts as regent. ENTITY4 is a
place outside of ENTITY2 where ENTITY1 rules from. Where an entity
leads a collective, use 'leads'. Where a ruler is also eponym, use
'rules as eponym'. 'Succeeds' also exists.

**Populates filecard categories 'ruled by', 'ruler of' (both d.obj and 'from' are places ruled)**

* **ENTITY1 rules as eponym ENTITY2** \for ENTITY3\] \[from ENTITY4\

ENTITY2 should be a place for which ENTITY1 is both ruler and eponym.
ENTITY3 is a minor or absent ruler for whom ENTITY1 acts as regent.
ENTITY4 is a place outside of ENTITY2 where ENTITY1 rules from. This
interaction is a shortcut; it is equivalent to creating two separate
ties ('rules' and 'is eponym of').

**Populates filecard categories 'ruled by', 'ruler of', 'eponym of', 'eponym'**

* **ENTITY1 succeeds ENTITY2** \in/on/at ENTITY3\

ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 are successive rulers of ENTITY3, which should be
a place. 'Gives' can also be used to express kingship. Where a king or
kingdom is strongly associated with both a region and a capital city
within that region, give both as ENTITY3 (E.g. 'Pandion succeeds
Cecrops in/on/at Athens, Attica').

**Populates filecard categories 'ruled by', 'ruler of' (both sbj and obj are rulers)**

* **ENTITY1 founds ENTITY2** \from ENTITY3\

Use only for founding of cities. For regions, islands etc use
'settles'. For sanctuaries, use 'establishes cult'. ENTITY3 is where
ENTITY1 comes from. Capture details of eponym, naming etc in separate
tie(s)

**Populates filecard categories 'founder of', 'founded by', 'founded from'**

* **ENTITY1 founds as eponym ENTITY2** \from ENTITY3\

Use only for founding of cities where ENTITY1 is both founder and
eponym of ENTITY2. For regions, islands etc use 'settles'; for
sanctuaries, use 'establishes cult'. ENTITY3 is where ENTITY1 comes
from. This interaction is a shortcut; it is equivalent to creating two
separate ties ('founds' and 'is eponym of').

**Populates filecard categories 'founder of', 'founded by', 'founded from', 'eponym of', 'eponym'**

* **ENTITY1 conquers ENTITY2**

Where ENTITY2 is also destroyed, use 'destroys' as well.

**Populates filecard categories 'conquered by'**

* **ENTITY1 settles ENTITY2** \from ENTITY3\

ENTITY2 should be a region or area, perhaps already inhabited, which
is settled by ENTITY1. ENTITY3 is where ENTITY1 comes from. 'Conquers'
also exists. Use 'founds' for cities. Where ENTITY1 is also eponym of
the region, use 'is eponym of' as well.

**Populates filecard categories 'settles', 'settled by', 'settled from'**

## 2.8.19 Connections to places

* **ENTITY1 resides** \in/on/at ENTITY2\] \[near\

If ENTITY2 is not a landmark, use only if action is not captured by a
more specific interaction. If ENTITY2 is a landmark, use only for
(semi-)permanent residence there.

**If 'in/on/at' contains a landmark, populates filecard categories 'dwelling', 'dwelling of'**

* **ENTITY is depicted** \Depicted on: ENTITY2\ \[with the involvement
of ENTITY3\]

ENTITY2 is the thing or place on or at which the depiction is
displayed. Use also for depictions created in the historical period.
ENTITY3 is the place that commissioned or was otherwise involved in
the creation of the object displayed at ENTITY2 (typically used where
a city dedicates a votive at Delphi or Olympia). You do not need to
capture depictions of Olympian gods, Heracles, Asclepios, Demeter,
Persephone, and personifications unless there is clear narrative
content or they are included in a grouping that seems significant in
some way.

**Populates filecard categories 'has depictions of', 'depictions'.**

* **ENTITY is a relic** \in/on/at\

Use where a mythic object or landmark is described as surviving in the
historical period, or an animal is so long-lived that it was born in
the mythic period and encountered in the historical period. Use with
an historical timemark; if the timemark is left empty, the relic was
in existence when the passage was written.

**Populates filecard categories 'survives as a relic at', 'relics preserved on site'**

**Triggers phenomenon 'preserved relics'**

* **ENTITY1 is moved** \from ENTITY2\] \[to ENTITY3\

ENTITY1 is a mythic relic moved during the historical period from
ENTITY2 to ENTITY3. Use with a timemark; if the timemark is left
empty, the relic was being moved when the passage was written.

**Populates filecard categories 'moved in the historical period from/to', 'survives as a relic at', 'relics preserved on site' (places drawn from both 'to' and 'from' fields)**

**Triggers phenomenon 'preserved relics'**

* **ENTITY1 is entrance to ENTITY2**

Use only to capture entrances to the Underworld. ENTITY2 must be 'the
Underworld'.

**Populates filecard categories 'serves as entrance to' and 'entrances:'**

**Triggers phenomenon 'entrances to underworld'**

* **ENTITY1 flows into ENTITY2**
> Both ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 are waterways, typically rivers or springs. Use only where they are said to flow into or out of one another against geographical accuracy.
>
> **Populates filecard category 'flows into or out of'**
>
> **Triggers phenomenon 'impossible waterways'**

* **ENTITY fortifies ENTITY**
> When walls and gates exist in MANTO as fortifications (see
> 2.4.4(#creating-places-and-landmarks)), use 'creates'
> instead.
> 
> **Populates filecard category 'fortified by'**

## 2.8.20 Movement

* **ENTITY1 travels** [from ENTITY2\] [to ENTITY3] [via ENTITY4]
> Use to capture complex travel itineraries in the mythical period with
> ENTITY4 used to capture stops along the route in order; use if action
> is not captured by a more specific interaction (e.g. 'visits',
> 'migrates').

* **ENTITY1 goes past ENTITY2**
> Use where ENTITY1 does not visit or stop at ENTITY2.

* **ENTITY1 crosses ENTITY2**
> Use where ENTITY1 crosses ENTITY2, which will be a specific waterway.

* **ENTITY1 shipwrecks ENTITY2 [in/on/at ENTITY3] [while intending to go to ENTITY4]**
> ENTITY1 causes the shipwreck; ENTITY2 is shipwrecked (including the
> vessel if it is an entity in MANTO). ENTITY4 is the place ENTITY2 was
> heading towards. Where no god (etc.) is identified as causing the
> shipwreck, use '[BLANK]' shipwrecks '[ENTITY]'.
>
> **Triggers phenomenon 'shipwrecks'**

* **ENTITY sends ENTITY** [against] [from] [to] [via]

* **ENTITY1 expels ENTITY2** [from ENTITY3] [to ENTITY4]

* **ENTITY searches for ENTITY** [in/on/at] [from] [to] [via]

* **ENTITY flees** [from] [to] [via]

* **ENTITY1 encounters ENTITY2**

Use only if action is not captured by a more specific interaction.
Both ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 should typically be agents or collectives.

* **ENTITY migrates** [from] [to]

Use where an entity changes their homeland in a (semi-)permanent
manner (e.g. a woman is born into a family from one region and marries
into a family in another) and the action cannot be captured by a more
specific interaction.

## 2.8.21 Miscellaneous, disambiguation and conflation

### **ENTITY is associated with ENTITY**
> Use only if not captured by a more specific interaction.

### **ENTITY1 is mentioned**
> Use where there is no other entity in MANTO to connect ENTITY1 to.
> These ties should only have subject and predicate. Particularly useful
> when collecting data from fragments, where sometimes a name appears
> with no context.

### **ENTITY is conflated with ENTITY**
> Use where two entities that are ontologically distinct in MANTO are
> said to be the same entity. When a mythic entity is identified in the
> historical period, use 'is identified \as\'. When the context is the
> syncretism of Greek and non-Greek entities, use '\Non-Greek entity\
> is identified as \Greek entity\' (see [4.4](4_issue.md/#44-syncretism-of-gods-and-goddesses))
>
> **Populates filecard category 'sometimes conflated with'**

### **ENTITY1 is identified as ENTITY2**
> ENTITY1 is a mythic entity; ENTITY2 is an historical entity. 'Is
> identified [in/on/at]' also exists.
>
> **Populates filecard category 'identified as'**

### **ENTITY1 is identified** [in/on/at] ENTITY2 [near]
> ENTITY1 is a mythic entity; ENTITY2 is an historical entity. 'Is
> identified as' also exists
> 
> **Populates filecard category 'identified in' (only on sbj's filecard)**

### **[Non-Greek entity] is identified as [Greek entity]**
> Use to capture syncrecism of Greek and non-Greek deities and heroes.
> See [4.4](4_issues.md/#44-syncretism-of-gods-and-goddesses).

### **Populates filecard category 'identified as'**

* **Triggers phenomenon 'syncretism'**

* **ENTITY is** **located** [in/on/at] \[near\

Use to express topographical relationships which are not ontologically
stable enough to be captured as attributes of the entity itself. Often
used to express relationships between mythical places (e.g. locations
within the Underworld). Use 'is identified \as\' where a mythic
entity is identified in the historical period.

* **ENTITY is contemporary of ENTITY**

Use only where no other interaction captures the fact that two agents
or collectives belong to the same generation.

* **ENTITY is compared to ENTITY**

Use where a passage directly compares the qualities of two otherwise
unrelated entities, and no other interaction can be captured.
