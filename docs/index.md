Introducing MANTO

MANTO (Mapping Ancient Narratives, Territories, and Objects) is an
ambitious project to organize and visualize the data of Greek myth in
the digital sphere. It is a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and
intergenerational initiative involving researchers and students in
Australia and the USA.

Our approach is guided by the intellectual premise that Greek myth
existed in antiquity in what Tolkien described as a 'secondary world':
it was a fictional universe with coherent spatial and chronological
dimensions, and broadly consistent in its biological and cultural norms.
Yet the Greek *spatium mythicum* departs from the purely fictional model
of Middle Earth in two distinctive ways. Firstly, it was partially
co-terminous with the ancient here-and-now of the 'primary world'.
Mythic events took place in the deep past of the Mediterranean and so
their traces lingered in the *spatium historicum*. Secondly, the Greek
mythic storyworld was not the work of a single mind but created out of
the improvisation and negotiation of thousands of disparate communities
and hundreds of individual writers and artists over more than a
millennium. These two qualities make Greek myth a complex target for
analysis, but also a rich and rewarding one. Our ambitions to capture
and organize the data of Greek myth must always be tempered by a very
real appreciation for the inherent messiness of this material.

This manual describes how we collect machine-readable mythic data from
ancient texts. We want this project to create an authoritative, useful
resource. MANTO will only ever be as good as the quality of its data, so
thank you for helping us with this.
