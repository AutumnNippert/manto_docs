You can access this manual in the google drive [MANTO Manual for data
collectors]{.underline}](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kSAJ5tRrnDS2jIRw34lQSiYVmOj-s0Gf?usp=share_link).

You will also be given details for accessing MANTO's discord server,
which we use for asking and answering questions about data collection.
You may also be given a Nodegoat account to allow you to enter and edit
data directly.

If you notice problems with the data or this manual, have suggestions
for improvements, or would like to write a blog post on a topic related

# 5.2 Data lifecycle

Data collection has the following stages:

> **1. Data Collection:** Passages and entities identified and
> disambiguated; ties created and entered into Nodegoat. All work is
> checked against any resources (commentaries, topostext etc.) for
> missed allusions, accuracy of URNs, correct use of the MANTO
> methodology etc.
>
> **2. Final Check:** All data is checked once more by either Greta or
> Scott. At this stage the ties are marked 'checked'.
>
> **3. Attention Required:** Issues still flagged as 'attention
> required' are resolved by Greta and/or Scott. At this stage the ties
> are marked 'Add to public interface'. The data populate filecards and
> become visible in the [public
> interface]{.underline}](https://manto.unh.edu/viewer.p/60/2616/scenario/1/geo/).

All data remains editable even once it has been added to the public
interface. In addition, changes implemented to the underlying data
structure (including reversals) may affect how data is displayed.

Researchers can request particular parts of MANTO data be downloaded as
.csv files from Nodegoat in support of specific projects. These data are
made available through a google drive.
